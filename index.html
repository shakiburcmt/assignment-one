            various forms,
            including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy
            medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.</p>

            <p>Donors often consider donating cash to be the quickest, most convenient way to give. Many charities allow
                you to give online via a credit card in seconds. Although it may be convenient for you, keep in mind
                that your charity will likely have to pay a credit card processing fee of 2.2% to 7.5% per transaction.
